[h2c](https://github.com/fstab/h2c) can now be used to analyze HTTP/2 traffic
from any Web browser.

![wiretap]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/2015-08-28-wiretap.gif)

### Example

{% highlight bash %}
h2c wiretap localhost:8443 example.com:443
{% endhighlight %}

This will listen for incoming connections on _localhost_ port 8443, and forward
the HTTP/2 traffic to _example.com_. All traffic will be printed to the console.

[h2c](https://github.com/fstab/h2c) is currently HTTPS only, plain text connections
are not supported.
